When we were given the task of creating a product for our Software Engineering class, we wanted to create something that we believe that many people would use. When it comes to current applications for voting on the market, all of them implement a majority vote / winner takes all approach. We found this to be an issue as this voting system, although it is simple and seemingly fair, fails to reflect the thoughts and opinions of a group of people. We wanted to create Poll Up as a way for people to easily and conveniently create polls using various voting methods on the internet, and hope to educate and to bring awareness about the methods of which decision making within a group can be made. </span></p>
